# Ruby-Teaching

This folder holds some extremely simple Ruby programs useful for teaching early level programming logic and reasoning. These also don't use OOP yet, which is a great introduction.

The concepts bring together simple ideas around utilising memory and making data structures to hold information. These include tic tac toe, calculator and rock paper sissors.
